# id3-js

A simple JavaScript library which can read ID3 tag from a audio file.

## Research material

Research material for how the ID3 tag works in various versions of it. Most of it is from the official website
[id3.org](https://www.id3.org/) but that seems to be down for a couple of years so I'm referencing
[web.archive.org](https://web.archive.org) instead.
